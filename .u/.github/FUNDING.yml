# A **Sponsors-enabled username** on GitHub is a user or organization account that has [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) activated. This means other users can financially support them through GitHub’s sponsorship platform.

# ### How to make your username Sponsors-enabled:

# 1. **Go to [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors).**
# 2. Click **“Get started with Sponsors”** or visit [https://github.com/sponsors/signup](https://github.com/sponsors/signup).
# 3. Follow the steps to **set up your Sponsors profile** (you’ll need to provide payout information and complete verification).
# 4. Once approved, your profile will display a **“Sponsor”** button, and you’ll be Sponsors-enabled.

# **Note:**  
# - GitHub Sponsors may not be available in all countries.
# - You must meet [GitHub’s eligibility requirements](https://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/getting-paid-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors-eligibility).
