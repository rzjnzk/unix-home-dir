#     test-colors - test terminal colors and display their ANSI and tput codes

# TODO: Find out the difference between and differentiate `printf e[38m` and `printf e[39m` as well as `printf e[48m` and `printf e[49m`.
# TODO: Remove colors from the loops and label them with their respective color names to allow checking if the terminal follows the color conventions.
# TODO: Add other formatting tests like bold, underline, etc. However, perhapse these should be added to a different script.
# TODO: Display each printed section in colomns, where each row is a specific color

# GitHub Copilot: `tput` can control the cursor position and visibility, but it cannot directly control the cursor shape or color. Here's how you can use `tput` for cursor control:

# - **Cursor position**: `tput cup Y X` moves the cursor to position (Y, X), where Y is the row number and X is the column number.
# - **Cursor visibility**: `tput civis` hides the cursor, and `tput cnorm` shows the cursor.

# As for the cursor shape and color, these are typically controlled by the terminal emulator or the operating system's settings, and are not something that can be changed from within a shell script. The exact steps to change these settings would depend on which terminal emulator and operating system you are using.

# GitHub Copilot: No, `tput` cannot directly set the terminal title or the icon. 

# However, you can use escape sequences to set the terminal title in most terminal emulators. Here's an example:

# ```bash
# echo -ne "\033]0;YOUR TITLE HERE\007"
# ```

# GitHub Copilot: You can use the `tput` command to get the terminal size. The `cols` sub-command gives the width of the terminal in characters, and the `lines` sub-command gives the height of the terminal in lines.

# Here's how you can use these commands:

# ```bash
# # Get the width of the terminal
# width=$(tput cols)

# # Get the height of the terminal
# height=$(tput lines)

# # Print the size
# echo "Width: $width"
# echo "Height: $height"
# ```

# Unfortunately, `tput` cannot be used to set the terminal size. The size of the terminal is controlled by the terminal emulator or the operating system, and cannot be changed from within a shell script.

# GitHub Copilot: `tput` is a command that can interact with the terminfo database to control terminal capabilities. Besides setting colors, `tput` can do a variety of things, including:

# - Move the cursor: `tput cup Y X` moves the cursor to position (Y, X), where Y is the row number and X is the column number.
# - Clear the screen: `tput clear` clears the screen and moves the cursor to the top-left corner.
# - Get terminal size: `tput cols` and `tput lines` return the width and height of the terminal, respectively.
# - Hide or show the cursor: `tput civis` hides the cursor, and `tput cnorm` shows the cursor.
# - Enable or disable standout mode: `tput smso` enables standout mode, and `tput rmso` disables standout mode. Standout mode is used to make some text stand out, usually by reversing the foreground and background colors.
# - Enable or disable underlining: `tput smul` enables underlining, and `tput rmul` disables underlining.
# - Enable or disable bold mode: `tput bold` enables bold mode.
# - Scroll the window: `tput ind` scrolls the window up one line, and `tput ri` scrolls the window down one line.
# - Play a bell sound: `tput bel` plays a bell sound.

# Remember that not all of these capabilities are supported by all terminals. The actual effect of these commands can vary depending on the terminal emulator you are using.
